#Challenge Overview
This challenge requires you to create a simple application which would fulfill the use cases mentioned below by using the most number of technologies you can to build the application. Try to use the right tool for each of the use cases or its sub use case. We will be evaluating based on the relevant use of those technologies (i.e. we would add points to your score only if you are able to justify the use of that technology).

To do this, we are requiring you to submit an .xls file containing complete technology stacks that you have used along with the purpose for each of them. The more relevant technologies/libraries/frameworks you use, the more chance you have of winning the challenge. Please do keep in mind that all use cases mentioned below should be achieved to mark a submission valid for review. If we do not get any submissions with all use cases, we will score the submissions based on the number of use cases completed and technologies used for those use cases. If a technology is used and not serving any use case, we will not count it towards your final score.

Here is the list of use cases:
- User is able to register with basic fields (username, password and a few demographic fields)
- User is able to login as registered user
- User is able to reset his/her password
- After user lands on the dashboard page
- User canâ€™t see the dashboard page without login
- On dashboard page, there is at least one of followings:
- User should be able to log out from the application
- A pane where at least two widgets are available to use
- User can drag and drop those widgets in content area
- At least one widget shows a graph (any chart would work pie, linear, bar etc)
- At least one widget shows data from any public api e.g. public tweets mentioning a particular keyword or showing list of trending - - videos or showing weather information or anything that you can imagine.
- Each widget should support configuring at least one property, which cause the re-render of the widget with new settings.
- Technology/Library/Framework can be anything which avoids reinventing the wheel (e.g. video player library, charting library etc) i.e. which either prevent coding something which is already there in market or at least allow better code maintenance for support engineers.

Further, there is no restriction on technologies, you can choose a backend technology e.g. some REST API, caching library etc or it can be a front end technology e.g. video player library, charting library etc.
